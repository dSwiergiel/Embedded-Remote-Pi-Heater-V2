# Embedded-Remote-Pi-Heater-V2
Embedded electronics project with full MEAN stack implementation. 

Goal: convert "dumb" household heater appliance to "smart" IoT device through embedded Raspberry Pi integration.

I embedded a Raspberry Pi Zero W with the motherboard of an electric heater I use in my apartment. This is the full software stack that includes the web client user interface, the pi client, and the server.
